# hello-world

The canonical hello-world repo. :)

Coding is such a beautiful concept to me. Pulling ideas from the ether and building them from scratch. Nothing merges the quintessential human behaviour, creating, with the deeply futuristic promise of technology. Code has, will, and continues to change the world.

Hoping to be a part of that ride.
